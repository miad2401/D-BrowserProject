IF you want you add to this project just know:
3.Inaproppiate material is NOT allowed.
4.Please try to give me advance warning as to what your are doing.

Also i use and edit all of the C# files in visual studio. I definetly reccomend using this if you plan on helping edit.

All that is here is the source code, NOT the application. You need a C# compiler to get an application. There is an application posted under releases.

Thank you,
