IF you want you add to this project just know:
1.It is written all in VB at the momment.
2.Inaproppiate material is NOT allowed.
3.Please try to give me advance warning as to what your are doing.

Also i use and edit all of the VB files in visual studio. I definetly reccomend using this if you plan on helping edit.

All that is here is the source code, NOT the application. You need a VB compiler to get an application. There is an application posted Under releases.

Thank you,
